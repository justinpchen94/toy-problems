// Description:
// Write a function that accepts a 2-dimensional array (that is, an array containing many same-length arrays),
// and prints out every value found, but in a spiral from the upper left in to the center.

// Test Cases:
// spiralTraversal([ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ], [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ], [ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ], [ 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 ] ]]) => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 19, 18, 17, 12, 13 ]
// spiralTraversal([ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ], [ 10, 11, 12 ], [ 13, 14, 15 ], [ 16, 17, 18 ], [ 19, 20, 21 ], [ 22, 23, 24 ] ]) => [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 23, 22, 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 ]
// spiralTraversal([ [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ] ]) => [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

// spiralTraversal([ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ] ]) =>[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]


// Code:
function spiralTraversal (matrix) {
  
}
