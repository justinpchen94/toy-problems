// Description:
// Write a function that accepts two strings as arguments, and returns only the characters that are common to both strings.

// Your function should return the common characters in the same order that they appear in the first argument. Do not return duplicate characters and ignore whitespace in your returned string.

// Example: commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu')

// Returns: 'aeiou'

// Code:
commonCharacters = function(string1, string2){

};
