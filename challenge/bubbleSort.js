// Description:
// Bubble sort is considered the most basic sorting algorithm in Computer Science. It works by starting at the first element of an array and comparing it to the second element:

// If the first element is greater than the second element, it swaps the two.
// It then compares the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and so on.
// In this way, the largest values ‘bubble’ to the end of the array.
// Once it gets to the end of the array, it starts over and repeats the process until the array is sorted numerically.
// Implement a function that takes an array and sorts it using this technique.

// NOTE: DO NOT use JavaScript’s built-in sorting function (Array.prototype.sort).

// Code:

var bubbleSort = function(array) {
  
};
