// Description: In an array of every possible anagram of a given string, what index would the original string occupy?

// Consider an anagram as any sequence of letters. For any word with at least two different letters, there are other words composed of the same letters but in a different order (for instance, RESISTANCE/ANCESTRIES, which happen to both be dictionary words; for our purposes “SISTANERCE” is also a “word” composed of the same letters as these two).

// Given a word, return its index number, starting at 1 (not 0), for some reason.

// Here is the catch: Your function should be able to accept any word 20 letters or less in length (possibly with some letters repeated), and take no more than 5000 milliseconds to run.

// Test Cases:
// anagramPosition("BAEBEE" ) => 12
// anagramPosition("ABBS" ) => 1
// anagramPosition("BABS" ) => 4
// anagramPosition("ARCTIC" ) => 42
// anagramPosition("STARK"  ) => 92

// Code:
function anagramPosition (string) {
  // Write your code here, and
  // return your final answer.
}
