// Description:

// Each number key on a standard phone keypad has a set of Latin letters written on it as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Telephone-keypad2.svg

// Businesses often try to come up with clever ways to spell out their phone number in advertisements to make it more memorable. But there are a lot of combinations!

// Write a function that takes up to four digits of a phone number, and returns a list of all of the words (in alphabetical order) that can be written on the phone with that number. (You should return all permutations, not only English words.)

// Test Cases:
// telephoneWords("00002") => [ "000A", "000B", "000C" ]
// telephoneWords("1123") => [ "11AD", "11AE", "11AF", "11BD", "11BE", "11BF", "11CD", "11CE", "11CF" ] 

// Code:

function telephoneWords(digitString) {

}
