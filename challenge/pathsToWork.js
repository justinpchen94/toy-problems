// Description:
// You live at (0,0) coordinate on a map, and your work is located at e units east and s units south from where you live.
// Assuming that you can only travel east and south, return the number of possible unique paths to take to work.

// Try utilizing some kind of lookup table or memoization to optimize the time complexity.

// Test Cases:
// pathsToWork(1,0) => 1
// pathsToWork(0,1) => 1
// pathsToWork(2,2) => 6
// pathsToWork(4,4) => 70

// Code:
function pathsToWork (e, s) {

}
